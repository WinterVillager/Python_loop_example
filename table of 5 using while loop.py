# third method
# using while loop

a = 1
while a < 11: # while function always needs to have a true condition to initialise
    print ("5 X",a, "=", 5*a)
# we need to make the condition false otherwise it will run infinitily
    a = a+1

'''the main difference is for loop can only run finite times
but while loop can run infinitly times'''
